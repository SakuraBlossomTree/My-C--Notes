- [ ] Expand the notes into something more detail that I can refer to
- [ ] Put examples here by getting mermaid to work

# Trees

The root node is at the top of the tree and there can be only one root node

the order of an tree is the maximum amount of children in the tree

the degree of the tree is how many children does the root node have

the height of the tree is the maximum number of the level of a tree

### 2 Tree

it is a tree in which each node has only two nodes (Need to change this)

### Node labelling

The root node is labelled as x and the left node is 2x+1 and right node as 2x+2

Usually the root node is labelled as 0

**Make a diagram of the above concept**

A complete binary tree is a tree where the node labels forms a complete interval if there n then node labels must be 

### Full Binary tree

It is a binary tree where all the levels in the binary tree must be completed

### Trasversal

Trasversal is a operation where each element in a tree is a transversed in a systematic order

Two types of searches 

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

#### Depth-First Search(DFS)

- Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
- Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right) is used to get a copy of a tree
- Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root) is used to delete a a tree

BFS is used if the goal is to reach the end nodes

DFS is used if you want to explore a branch as much as possible
